This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npx react-native run-android

# OR using Yarn
yarn react-native run-android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npx react-native run-ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn react-native run-android
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Configure React Native Voice
```sh
yarn add @react-native-voice/voice

# or

npm i @react-native-voice/voice --save
```

Link the iOS package

```sh
npx pod-install
```

## Step 4: Configure React Native Vector Icons
## Installation

1. Install the package via npm:
   ```sh
   npm install --save react-native-vector-icons
    ```
2.  Depending on the platform you're targeting (iOS/Android/Windows), follow the appropriate setup instructions.
3.  If you're planning to use FontAwesome 5 or 6 icons, refer to these guides: [FontAwesome 5](FONTAWESOME5.md) | [FontAwesome 6](FONTAWESOME6.md)

### iOS Setup
To use the bundled icons on iOS, perform the following step:

- Edit `Info.plist` and add a property called **Fonts provided by application** (or **UIAppFonts** if Xcode autocomplete is not working):
  - <details><summary>List of all available fonts to copy & paste in Info.plist</summary>
  
    ```xml
    <key>UIAppFonts</key>
    <array>
      <string>AntDesign.ttf</string>
      <string>Entypo.ttf</string>
      <string>EvilIcons.ttf</string>
      <string>Feather.ttf</string>
      <string>FontAwesome.ttf</string>
      <string>FontAwesome5_Brands.ttf</string>
      <string>FontAwesome5_Regular.ttf</string>
      <string>FontAwesome5_Solid.ttf</string>
      <string>FontAwesome6_Brands.ttf</string>
      <string>FontAwesome6_Regular.ttf</string>
      <string>FontAwesome6_Solid.ttf</string>
      <string>Foundation.ttf</string>
      <string>Ionicons.ttf</string>
      <string>MaterialIcons.ttf</string>
      <string>MaterialCommunityIcons.ttf</string>
      <string>SimpleLineIcons.ttf</string>
      <string>Octicons.ttf</string>
      <string>Zocial.ttf</string>
      <string>Fontisto.ttf</string>
    </array>
    ```
    
  </details>

   Above step might look something like this:

_Note: Recompile your project after adding new fonts._
For **Android**:
#### Option: With Gradle (recommended)

To make font management smoother on Android, use this method:

- Edit `android/app/build.gradle` (NOT `android/build.gradle`) and add:

  ```gradle
  apply from: file("../../node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/fonts.gradle")
  ```

  To customize the fonts being copied, use:

  ```gradle
  project.ext.vectoricons = [
      iconFontNames: [ 'MaterialIcons.ttf', 'EvilIcons.ttf' ] // Specify font files
  ]

  apply from: file("../../node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/fonts.gradle")

  ```
